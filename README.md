This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

first of all clone this repo in your local machine using this command:
--> ```git clone https://github.com/drleavio/grindaAIassesment```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

the dependencies I have used for this projects are as follows

--> Next.js for frontend and backend using Typescript
--> Supabase for database and authentication
--> OpenAI API for integrating AI inside the app for extracting sentiments and summaries
--> React Toastify for popup or notifications
--> SASS or SCSS for styling
--> I have used app directory not the pages folder

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.
